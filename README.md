#Project 2: Instagrid

Project 2 for RED Academy Web Development Program.

##Summary

This webpage pulls Instagram hashtags through API to display a list of recently tagged photos. When the image is hovered, the user information slides up including profile picture, username, likes, and comments. There is a Load More feature which pulls twelve additional photos with each request.

##Tools and Methods

-HTML/CSS
-Flexbox
-jQuery
-Ajax request from Instagram API
-Responsive design
-Gulp, SASS, Autoprefixer, Browser-Sync

##Experience

This project introduced SASS, which I find is a much better way to organize CSS styling. This project was also my first trial of Browser-Sync which is quite a handy developer tool. Using the ajax call was the most useful skill I took from this project.
